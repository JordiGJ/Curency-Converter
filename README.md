# Curency-Converter
Vanilla JS Currency Converter

The user can choose the currencies form a dropdown list and the amount they want to see the exchange value.

This app uses the data from the https://www.exchangerate-api.com/. You will need to change the value of the const 'apiKey' in the script.js file to your own key.

This is my version of a project you can find here https://www.100jsprojects.com/
